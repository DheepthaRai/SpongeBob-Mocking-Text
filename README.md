# SpongeBob Mocking Text

Code in python and java to generate 'SpongeBob mocking text' (spongemock), which is a writing style used by internet communities to mock something, by randomly casing the letters of any sentence.

Some even use it to bring equality to the other letters of sentences by randomly capitalising them, a concept introduced by the fictional character Margo, in John Green's 'Papertowns' (a book that made it to big screens by the same name too).
